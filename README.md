# Website for the FreeShow program

FreeShow is a presentation program to easily show text on a big screen, with support for stage display, remote control, media, and many more advanced features. It is open sourced meaning anyone can contribute.

I created this program because I felt like all the good programs were way too expensive. This can be used for free everywhere, from a small church to a big concert. Donations will be appreciated if you want to support the development of this program!
