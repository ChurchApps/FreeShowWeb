# Website for the FreeShow program

FreeShow is a free and open-source presentation program that makes it easy to show text on a big screen. It supports stage display, remote control, media, and many other advanced features. It is open-sourced meaning anyone can contribute.

FreeShow exists because the creator found that other similar programs were either expensive or complex to use. He wanted to create a program that is easy to use and affordable for everyone, from small churches to large venues. FreeShow is now used by people all over the world.
