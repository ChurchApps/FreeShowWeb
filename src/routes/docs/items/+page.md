# Items

There are different types of items you can add, depending on what you want to present.

After adding a new item, you can edit its properties on the right side, by clicking on the tab left to "Item", and "Items" with the currently selected item name.

Here is a list of the items:

### Text

This is the most common, and it is for adding text to a slide, or just a general shape.

### Media

This is for adding images or videos to your slide.

### Website

Load a website or a local html file. You can navigate this in the output window.

### Timer

This is for adding a timer to your slide, that can be controlled from [Timers](./functions#timers) under the "Functions" tab in the drawer. You can also change the type to show a line or circle going from 100% filled to 0%.

### Clock

Show the system time either analog or digital.

### List

Create a list of different things that you can show as a list, or set a time so they can change automatically.

### Camera

Select a camera input feed.

### Variable

Add a dynamic item to your slide. For creating and changing variables [see this](./functions#variables).

### Progress

Add a progress meter to display the current slide progress. Choose between "Number"/"Progress bar"/"Groups". "Groups" will show all the show groups and the currently active one. NOTE: Ignore a group by prefixing it with "~"!

### Events

This item will display upcoming events from the "Calendar" tab, either to a selected date, or today/tomorrow etc.

### Weather

Display weather forecast information by providing the latitude and longitude of the position. Either show for the current day, or four days forward in time.

### Visualizer

Show a visualizer for playing audio. This will show some lines changing height depending on the frequency and volume of the playing audio. Might cause some lag.

### Captions

Add live speech to text captions to your slide.

### Icon

This is for adding an SVG icon to your slide.
