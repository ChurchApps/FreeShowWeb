# Adding chords

When editing a show, you get a few buttons at the center bottom. One of them displays a "note" icon with the label "Chords". Click on it to enable chords mode, this will display any existing chords. In this mode you can click on any letter to add a chord, this will display a popup where you can choose any chord.

Once you have added a few chords, you can select them in the bottom left to more quickly add existing chords to your song. You can also quickly remove any chord by middle mouse clicking it.

## Display chords on main display

To display chords on the main display, you have to select the textbox in the "Edit" tab, and enable the "Chords" option on the right side. You can use a template, or the "Copy" option to easily add the current item settings to all slides.

## Display chords on stage display

To display chords on the stage display, you have to select the textbox in the "Stage" tab, and enable the "Chords" option on the right side.

## Transposing chords

FreeShow offers two different ways to transpose chords, each serving different purposes:

### Global transpose (Show-level)

This method changes the chords in the show file itself, affecting all displays (main and stage) that use this show.

**How to use global transpose:**

1. Go to the **Edit** page for your show
2. Click on **Text edit** at the bottom of the screen
3. Look for the **up and down arrow buttons** at the bottom of the text editor (just above the bottom navigation bar)
4. Click the **up arrow** to transpose up a semitone or the **down arrow** to transpose down a semitone
5. Continue clicking to reach your desired key

**When to use:** When you want to permanently change the key of a song, or when creating different layouts for the same song in different keys.

### Local transpose (Stage display only)

This method transposes chords only on the stage display device, without changing the original show file. The transposition is stored in the browser cache and persists even if the stage display is reloaded.

**How to use local transpose:**

1. Open the **Stage display** on your device
2. Ensure chords are enabled and visible
3. Click on the **text box** containing the chords
4. A **transpose option** will appear
5. Use the transpose controls to adjust the key up or down
6. To reset back to the original show key, set the transpose value to **0**

**When to use:** When different musicians need the same song in different keys.
