# Groups

All the current groups are located at the right side of a show. One group can be a verse, and another for chorus. A group can have multiple slides. Click or drag a group from the right to the center to add it to your current [layout](./layouts). Changing the slide in one group, will change all of the same groups in your layouts at the same time. Groups can be changed from the context menu.

Editing a global slide in the editor will update all the slides in the layout that uses the same group. Notice that a group with the same name can be added multiple times, and will automatically be assigned a number. If you use the **Text edit** editor, the text you input is what you get out, meaning any groups with the exact same text will be merged into one, and any differences results in different groups.

### None groups

Renaming a group to "." or setting it to the "None" option will mark it as a hidden group, which will not show up in the groups list on the right. This can be useful for presentations, or if you don't want the same group to be added multiple times.

## Global groups

You can add global groups in the settings, when you edit a global group all of the slides with it will update with the new name/color. You can also access these in the right "Groups" menu of any show.

All global groups can also have a keyboard key linked to it, so say you set the letter "V" for "Verse", this means that every time you press "V" on your keyboard it will play the first verse in the selected show, or go to the next verse after the current outputted verse.

## Group numbers

In the settings you can toggle a group numbers switch. When this is enabled all of the same groups will automatically get a number based on their position. E.g. "Verse 1" and "Verse 2" if they are different, or "Verse" and "Verse (1)" if they are the same.

:::admonition type=tip

Using the "Slide progress" item will show the current slide number, but can also be changed to display all of the groups with a highlighted current group. If you want to hide a certain group from this list, you can prefix it with "~".
