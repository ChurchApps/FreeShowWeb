# Show tools

The show tools are located on the right side when you are in "Show" view, with a show selected. Here is a list describing all the tools:

### Groups

Here you will find all of the current groups in the current show, and a list of all your global groups. Click or drag them to the center to add them to the current layout.

### Media

See all of the media layers in all of the layouts. This includes all of the backgrounds, audio, microphones and actions.

### Metadata

Set metadata like title, artist and CCLI data about the current song. This can be enabled to display under the output settings. You can also get the EXIF metadata from JPEG images set as background. Also at the bottom you can change the looks and change the slides they are showing at. This can also be set globally on the output with [Styles](./styles).

In addition you can type a "Message" here that will display on all the slides when the show is playing. Right click the message textbox for the ability to add dynamic values.

To get a custom layout on the metadata, edit your metadata template with custom text and add the metadata values with dynamic values (can be added with right click).

### Recording

Slide recording is a cool feature if you know the timing of a song is going to be precise. The moment you press "Start recording" and a slide is active it will start tracking the amount of time each slide will play. Making you able to replay the exact same sequence multiple times. If you need multiple recordings for the same show, create a new layout.

The best part about this feature is that you can sync it to play with any music file added to the start slide of the recording (often the first slide of the show). This way you can record it with sync to some playback music and know it will be timed correctly.

Pressing the arrow keys while a slide recording is playing will play next/previous slide in the recorded order. This will also change the music time if synced. Clicking any slide will also move the current play time to the nearest point in time when that slide was played.

### Notes

Add some notes to the show.
