### Grid view

This is the most common view. Here you can see all of the slides as they are outputted in a grid. Useful for presenting.

### Simple view

This is a trimmed down version of the grid view. All the slide icons, labels, and also any disabled slides are hidden.

### List view

All of the slides from the grid view are shown on the left in a list, and on the right you can quickly change the text of any textboxes on the slides. Useful for quick editing of typos.

### Lyrics view

This is similar to the remote lyrics view, this is all of the text in a list without any formatting. Useful if you want to sing along while presenting.
