# Calendar

> Create repeated events, and easily create a slideshow from any selected events. You can also schedule actions to run at a certain time.

## Creating an event

If you have an existing calendar with events you can [import the events](./importing#calendar) from an .ics file.

Add a new event from the "New event" button in the center, or edit an existing event in the right panel. You will get a popup with different options, including enabling "Repeat" if the event is repeated in a specific pattern.

### Merging events to a show

If you hold down the mouse while dragging, or hold CTRL/CMD you can select multiple events. On the right panel you can see a short summary of all the added events. Here you can also "Include slides from show", if you select a show. Lastly click the "New show" button to create a show with the events added in an easy to read format, and it also has "go to next slide" timers.

## Schedule actions

If you select "Schedule action" on the left side, you can add events to automatically start specific actions any time in the future, as long as FreeShow is opened. This will notify you about it starting a minute before it runs.
