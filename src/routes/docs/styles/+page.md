# Change the output styling

> Use styles to override the output with different looks.

## Background

Change the background color, or set a background image that will always show when you clear all.

## Aspect ratio

Change the output aspect ratio. It's 16/9 by default, but you can also set it to automatically fit the output window aspect ratio. If this is different to the output aspect ratio, the content will be contained inside. Also there are some more handy features here.

## Lines

If you set this to e.g. 2 all the textboxes will show max 2 lines in the output at the time. This is useful if you want a second live stream output to only show 2 lines at a time, while another output shows all the lines.

## Toggle layers

Click on the different active layers to toggle them, useful again if you don't want to show the background in a livestream.

## Template

You can set a template to override the output style to get different styles in outputs with the same input, useful for [lower thirds](./outputs#how-to-create-lower-third-display-for-a-live-stream). The template text color will be used, unless the slide item text has multiple colors, in that case the original colors will be used!

:::admonition type=tip

If a media item in the template has on set file path, and the background layer is turned off in the style; any slide backgrounds on the first slide (or current) in the show will be applied to the item.

## Metadata

Change the looks of show metadata or a show message, and choose when to display the metadata.
