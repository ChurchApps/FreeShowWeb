# Introduction

> FreeShow is a free and open-source program to show slides and lyrics on a screen.

The project was started in late 2021, with the first release in February 2022.

The program was created because I couldn't find any free and good software to match the expensive ones in features, usability and looks. I really wanted to make it as easy to understand and use as possible. It might take some time getting used to, but I believe it will make the process of creating and showing lyrics and media easy and fun.

FreeShow is available on Windows, macOS and Linux. It has many good features, and is still in active development, so it should get more amazing and unique features.

If you haven't already, you can download the application from the homepage: [freeshow.app](https://freeshow.app)
