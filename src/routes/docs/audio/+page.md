# Audio

> Play local audio files directly from FreeShow.

Click on any file to play. Settings can be adjusted on the right side. You can also create an audio playlist.

### Audio effects

When an audio clip is shorter than 30 seconds it will be treated as an audio effect, this can be changed in the settings. The difference is that multiple audio effects can be played at once. While normal "songs" only can play one at a time (unless you hold ALT while starting.). You can right click any audio clip and press "Add to effects library" to add it to a custom sound effect board for easy access.

### Metronome

On the right side of the audio drawer a metronome player can be found. You can adjust the timing how you like it, and drag the "Play button" on to any slide to start with the selected settings when that slide is triggered.

#### NowPlaying

When an audio file is playing FreeShow will generate a "NowPlaying.txt" file in an Audio folder in the set Data location. And also a "NowPlayingCover.png" file with any album cover art.

The text file can be used for other radio programs to render the title, artist and album of the currently playing song, and the cover can be added as an image to FreeShow, and it will be automatically updated. This can be used along side with dynamic values to display the currently playing info on the screen.
