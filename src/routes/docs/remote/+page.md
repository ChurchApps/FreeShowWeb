# Remote

> Remote is used to controll the show from another device connected to the same router.

If you are ready to connect, [see this](./connecting).

Also the remote has a randomly set password for security reasons. You can find it in the settings, under the "Connection" tab. You can change this or set it to nothing to disable the password.

## The different tabs

### Search (Shows)

See a list of all your shows (same as the "Shows" drawer), click them to open. If you enable the "Quick play" the show will automatically play from this list. At the top there is a search bar to quickly find the show you are looking for.

### Scriptures

If you have any offline Bibles imported they will show up here, and you can use this to present scripture from your phone.

### Project

If you have a project active it will be automatically opened, if not you will see a list of all your projects and open them. You can click the tab multiple times to toggle between the opened project and all projects.

### Show

When you open a show, or a show is already active, you can see all the slides here, click on one of them to play. At the bottom you can also change layout if multiple are available, or click "Groups" or "Edit" to edit the groups layout or text content.

### Output

When a slide is outputted this tab will be enabled, here you can see the playing slide and the next one. You can also toggle to "Lyrics" mode to see all the text in a list without the styling.

Click on the right side of the screen to go to next, and click on the left (1/3) to go to the previous slide.
